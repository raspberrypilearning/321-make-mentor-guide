## Which paths are available?

This is a rough guide to the 🥉🥈🥇321 🏅Make! paths and the order in which they can be completed along with suggestions for additional content for practice and breadth. This should be adapted to your creators based on their prior experience of computing which will vary significantly around the world. 

### Code Club World

If your creators don’t have previous experience with computers and do have a good internet connection and are English-speaking then we’d recommend that they create an Avatar (a character) on [Code Club World](https://codeclubworld.org/){:target="_blank"} to experience dragging and dropping blocks on a computer or mobile device. When they are ready, they can move on to Scratch. 

### Age 7+ 

We have three paths of 🐱 Scratch projects plus a 🐱 Scratch physical computing path for the [Raspberry Pi computer](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-getting-started){:target="_blank"}. 

**Start point** 

+ Start with 🥉🥈🥇🐱 [Intro to Scratch](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/scratch-intro){:target="_blank"}. No prior experience of Scratch is needed.

**Additional practice:**

These existing projects and paths use similar skills to those introduced in Intro to Scratch and provide an opportunity for additional practice either before or after the Design and Invent projects. 

Projects and paths:
+ 🐱 [Look after yourself path](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/look-after-yourself){:target="_blank"}
+ 🐱 [Rock Band](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rock-band){:target="_blank"} 
+ 🐱 [Lost in Space](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/lost-in-space){:target="_blank"} 
+ 🐱 [From me to you](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/from-me-to-you){:target="_blank"}
+ 🐱 [3D scene](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/3d-scene){:target="_blank"}

+ 🐱 [Shaun the Sheep: Mission to Space](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/shauns-space-mission){:target="_blank"}

** 🏅Independent making:**

Use the 🐱 [I made you a book](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/i-made-you-a-book){:target="_blank"} Invent project as a reference guide for reminders of the blocks and concepts that have been learned. 

Create a project that can be entered into the ✨ [Coolest Projects Showcase](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/scratch-coolest-projects){:target="_blank"}.
