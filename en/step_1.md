## Introduction

This guide is for facilitators using the Raspberry Pi Foundation's [321 Make! paths of projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/paths){:target="_blank"} in remote and in-person clubs or at events. Parents of home learners and more experienced creators may also find this guide useful. 

**Terminology:** In this guide we refer to the adult club leaders, educators, and mentors as **facilitators**; we refer to the young people they support as **creators**.

Our global community of awesome young <span style="color: #0faeb0">**creators**</span> have been growing their skills by making projects in clubs and at home for over a decade. Through sharing their creations they have inspired their peers around the world.

We will cover:
+ The motivation behind creating 321 Make! and the new paths of projects
+ The different kinds of projects in 321 Make!
+ Tips for using the paths to deliver engaging sessions

We would love to hear your thoughts about 321 Make!, the paths, and the projects. As you work through this guide, you will notice a 'Send feedback' button at the bottom of each step. This button appears on all our projects for you and your young creators to send feedback to us at any time.
