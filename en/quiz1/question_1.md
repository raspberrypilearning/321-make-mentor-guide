## Reflection

This is an example of a reflection quiz that you would find in an Explore project. It is a chance to celebrate new skills and creations. 

Reflection comes at the end of the main project-making steps but before any upgrades. Reflecting is an important part of learning, because it helps make new connections in your brain.

Creators answer three questions to reflect on what they've learned.

After each question, creators press 'Check my answer'. If an answer is incorrect, useful feedback guides them towards the correct answer. There is no limit to the amount of times creators can attempt each question.

Try this quiz out for yourself. Have fun!

+ In Invent projects creators use all their skills to meet a project brief

- ( ) Learn, Design, Invent

 --- feedback ---

Not quite, 'Learn' was one of our original options for the step-by-step projects, but a panel of creators from our community firmly told us they preferred a different name. ðŸ¤£
