## 3 Explore projects 

**Explore** projects are step-by-step instructions that:
+ introduce creators to a set of skills
+ help them develop initial confidence
+ build their interest and engagement  

Each path begins with **3** Explore projects that between them contain the set of skills and concepts needed for the entire path.

**Tip:** We recommend that facilitators complete the Explore projects themselves before running a session with creators. This familiarity with the project helps aniticpate issues and you can make note of discussion points.  

### Tasks 

Creators work through the project tasks, each task has a green background and a grey checkmark box in the top-right corner. Once a creator has completed the task they can check the box, this turns the checkmark into a green filled box and fades the content. 

--- task ---
 
Click on the checkmark box for this task to see what happens. 

Using the checkmark helps creators follow which tasks they have completed. It also helps facilitators when helping the creators to debug their projects. 

--- /task ---

Thare are several types of task including: 
+ **Choose:** - creators are encouraged to add personalisation to their projects. We view choice as important even in step-by-step Explore projects and offer choice throughout projects.  
+ **Test:** - creators run their project to see the outcome. Creators are encouraged to test regularly as they develop their project a bit at a time.
+ **Save:** - a reminder to save their projects where applicable. These tasks include guidance on how to save as well as acting as a reminder to save.
+ **Debug:** - contains hints, tips, and instructions to help creators solve common problems they find. Creators are also encouraged to celebrate bugs not listed by sharing them via the 'Send feedback' button 

### Try it Tasks

The Introduction step in Explore projects has a **Try it** task to be used at the beginning of your session. Investigation questions encourage creators to interact with the project. 

This sets the scene for your creators by encouraging them to play with the finished example of the project they will be creating. 

**Tip:** This type of task can be completed indpendently by the creators or together as an introduction to your session. 

Here is an example of a **Try it** task:

--- task ---
### Try it
<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 175px; flex-grow: 1">  
Click on each sprite to see what they do. 

What happens if you click on one sprite and then quickly click on another sprite?
</div>
<div class="scratch-preview" style="margin-left: 15px;">
  <iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/485673032/?autostart=false" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>
</div>
--- /task ---
--- /no-print ---

### Step introductions

The projects are split into pages (steps), each step begins with a description and image showing creators what they will have made by the end of the step. 

This is the **step introduction** from the 'Exhaust effects' step in our [Rocket launch](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rocket-launch){:target="_blank"} Explore project: 

--- task ---

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">

### Exhaust effects

The rocket will look more realistic with some special effects to simulate the exhaust trail. 

You can create cool effects by using a `for` loop to draw lots of shapes in each frame.

### Project boxouts

**Project boxouts** are used to highlight talking points and extra information such as industry links, role models, and interesting facts. 

**Tip:** Boxouts can be used as a group discussion point or read independently by creators.

--- task ---

Here is an example of a boxout from our [Catch the bus](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/catch-the-bus){:target="_blank"} Explore project where an animation is made: 

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Animation**</span> creates the effect of movement by changing pictures quickly. The first animators carved pictures out of wooden blocks and used them as stamps. It is much faster to use Scratch to code your animation!
</p>

### Info cards

**Info cards** in Explore projects are used to give extra information. They could add more detail about a skill, provide an alternative choice, or help debug a common problem. 

In this example from our [Grow a dragonfly](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/grow-a-dragonfly){:target="_blank"} Explore project the Info card is a guide explaining how to use the Scratch backpack feature and will only be expanded by those creators that want to know how to use it.

Click on the **Info card** below to expand it and again to close it:

### The Upgrade your project step

Each Explore project contains an **upgrade your project** step with ideas and aspirational projects for creators to develop their project further with the skills they have already. 

**Tip:** Upgrade steps are open ended so are great for a session where creators are working at different paces. They're also a chance to build localisation and personalise projects. 

**Tip:** At the end of a session you could have 'show and tell' where creators share their projects and talk about their creation process. This would be a good time to look at the upgrade options to celebrate how far their new skills can take them.   

Here is an example of an upgrade step from our Beating heart [Beating heart](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/beating-heart){:target="_blank"} Explore project:

--- task ---

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">

### Upgrade your beating heart

You could: 
+ Set it to a slow speed to help you relax 
+ Adjust the beat to match the music you are listening to
+ Add a blue LED to represent de-oxygenated blood entering and leaving the heart 
</div>
<div>
![Animated gif showing a papercraft heart with a red and a blue LED pulsing in time to the heartbeat.](images/two-beats.gif){:width="300px"}
</div>
</div>

--- /task ---

The upgrade step also contains an Info card with link to the completed solution. 

## The What next step

Explore projects end with a **what next** step that has links to the path overview and the next project in the path. 

There is also an embedded version of the next project in that path that creators can interact with.

**Tip:** You could end your session by looking at this step as a group and building excitment for the next project.

+ Explore projects begin with a **Try it:** step which is similar to the **Use** step in Use-Modify-Create. It is important that creators understand what a project is supposed to do. This provides context for the instructions that they follow. Each step also shows what they will achieve by the end of the step so that they have a clear understanding of the expected outcome. 
+ Beginning with **direct instruction** introduces new concepts in a structured way to ensure that creators are familiar with the skills that they will need to apply later on. 
+ **Step by step instructions** build early success and give creators the chance to gain familiarity with tools.
+ Explore projects **model** the best practices of building a project up step by step with regular testing and debugging. Professional software developers often learn new skills from more experienced colleagues. 
+ The projects follow principles from [**Universal Design for Learning**](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/universal-design-for-learning-in-computing-hello-world-15/){:target="_blank"} to support the inclusion of all young people. 
+ Small **choices** are built into the projects allow creators to feel more connected with their projects without making over-ambitious changes that can lead to frustration. 
+ Multiple choice questions at the end of the main project steps provide an opportunity to review and embed knowledge and is a form of **assessment for learning**. They also provide the opportunity to **celebrate** and **reflect** on what has been achieved.
+ Early success leads to an increase in **self-efficacy** which in know to be a factor in increasing future participation in computing.
